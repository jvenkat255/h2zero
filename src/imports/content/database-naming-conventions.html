</h3>

<p>
	Whilst everybody has their own database naming conventions, we recommend using snake_case as it is more readable 
	- especially for people of foreign languages.
</p>

<p>
	The naming of the {import src/imports/links/fields.templar} echoes throughout 
	the generated code and is a recommended way of keeping things consitent.  That 
	being said, there are no reasons that camelCase naming conventions will not work, 
	however this is untested.
</p>

<p>
	We also recommend that each field is prefixed with it's type, as listed 
	below.  This may not be a complete list, however it has stood us in good 
	stead.
</p>

<h3>Important!</h3>

<p>
	Each table that is generated <strong>MUST</strong> contain a primary key
	of type bigint.
</p>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>prefix</th>
			<th>meaning</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>

	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>id_</code></strong></td>
			<td>
				Primary key usage and unique identifiers.  In the case of a primary 
				key for a table, the recommended field name is <code>id_&lt;table_name&gt;</code>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>txt_</code></strong></td>
			<td>For textual representations</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>nm_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Proper names for fields, e.g. <code>nm_person</code>, <code>nm_country</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>num_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Numbers (integers/bigints)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>fl_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Flags - i.e. boolean types - should always be of type tinyint(1)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>cd_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Codes for the data - i.e. <code>cd_postcode</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>flt_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Floating point values.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>dbl_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Double precision values</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code></code></strong></td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>
	And whilst not actually required, this will help with the code generation 
	and keep it consistent throughout the code.
