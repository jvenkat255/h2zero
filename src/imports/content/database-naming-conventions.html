</h3>

<p>
	Whilst everybody has their own database naming conventions, we recommend 
	using snake_case as it is more readable - especially for people of foreign 
	languages.
</p>

<p>
	The naming of the {import src/imports/links/fields.templar} echoes throughout 
	the generated code and is a recommended way of keeping things consistent.  That 
	being said, there are no reasons that camelCase naming conventions will not work, 
	however this is untested.
</p>

<p>
	We also recommend that each field is prefixed with it's type, as listed 
	below.  This may not be a complete list, however it has stood us in good 
	stead.
</p>


<h3>Important!</h3>

<p>
	Each table that is generated <strong>MUST</strong> contain a primary key 
	of type bigint.
</p>

<h4>Why?</h4>

<p>
	There is nothing worse than having a table which doesn't have a unique primary 
	key, apart from one which is called <code>id</code>.  Plenty of times in the 
	code we will be using multiple primary keys from all sort of tables, so we 
	end up littering our code with <code>object.getId()</code>.  Rather than having 
	to distinguish between the different <code>id</code> variables, we like to know 
	what primary key it is referring to. (And with the 'extract to local variable 
	shortcut in our IDE - it means that the variable is named appropriately).
</p>

<p>
	<strong>For example:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<code>object.getIdPet()</code> will give us a completion of <code>Integer idPet = ...</code>, 
	and we __ALWAYS__ know that this is a unique identifier to a <code>Pet</code> in the 
	database, no matter where it comes from.
</p>

<h3>Suggestions for field names</h3>

<table>
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th>prefix</th>
			<th>meaning</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>

	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>id_</code></strong></td>
			<td>
				Primary key usage and unique identifiers.  In the case of a primary 
				key for a table, the recommended field name is <code>id_&lt;table_name&gt;</code>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>txt_</code></strong></td>
			<td>For textual representations</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>nm_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Proper names for fields, e.g. <code>nm_person</code>, <code>nm_country</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>num_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Numbers (integers/bigints)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>fl_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Flags - i.e. boolean types - should always be of type tinyint(1)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>cd_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Codes for the data - i.e. <code>cd_postcode</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>flt_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Floating point values.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>dbl_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Double precision values</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>tm_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Time values</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>dt_</code></strong></td>
			<td>Date values</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong><code>ts_</code></strong></td>
			<td>TimeStamp values</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>

<p>
	And whilst not actually required, this will help with the code generation 
	and keep it consistent throughout the code.
