<h3>The little things...</h3>

<h4>It is always the little things that make such a difference...</h4>

<p>
	We, at synapticloop, try our best to reduce those little, tiny, small annoyances 
	that irk you about other frameworks.  We code __A LOT__ so all of those little 
	things pretty soon add up to a major grievance.  Where we can, we try to catch 
	them up front, or at least flag them as errors to you.
</p>

<p>
	As we carry on our journey through our code, if there is anything that irks us, 
	even a little bit, that we could catch, we update the code and push out a new 
	version.  Here are some small examples:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>FATAL validation errors</strong> - we were tired of back-scrolling 
		through the lines of text to figure out where the fatal validation occurred - 
		so we print them out at the bottom as well
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><code>.h2zero</code> file expansion</strong> - we found that the h2zero 
		definition file just got too long and too complex, so we added in the import 
		command for tables.  Allowing us to split up each of the files per table.
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Regeneration changes nothing! <em>(apart from what has actually changed)</em></h4>

<p>
	On quite a frequent basis, we delete out <code>h2zero</code> generated code - we 
	<strong>always</strong> namespace our generated code clear of everything else.  
	We can then re-generate the code, and the only thing that has changed will show 
	up.  If nothing has changed, then out source code repository won't flag a thing.  
	In fact, you could just ignore the generated source code and generate in at build 
	time.
</p>

<h4>No Exceptions to the rule</h4>

<p>
	We generally use the <code>*Silent</code> methods on all of our calls - and then 
	test the return value.  This does have one down side though - if there is a 
	<code>SQLException</code> in what has been generated then this will also be 
	hidden - luckily we run through our unit tests to ensure that everything is 
	working as it should...
</p>

<h4>You have to have standards</h4>

<p>
	We use a standard naming convention for all of our finder / counter / updater / 
	deleter / question methods, that way we know what each method does explicitly 
	in the database.
</p>

<h4>Bound to be good</h4>

<p>
	We use a <code>static final String BINDER</code> for all of our model objects 
	and then reference them from  the other parts of the generated code.  This way 
	we always know if the underlying database changes (and a table is renamed or 
	deleted) that the <em>'dead'</em> code is then flagged by the compiler.
</p>
