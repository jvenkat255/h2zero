			</h3>

			<p>
				Views, similar to tables are a base object that then generates the model objects for interaction through the java code.  As 
				such  they are relatively straight-forward, the field definitions are the next important piece of the h2zero 
				generation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Views are optional and are not required to be present.
			</p>

			<pre class="prettyprint">
				<code>
"views": [{\n}
{\t}{{{\n}
{\t}{\t}"name": "user_type",{\n}
{\t}{\t}...{\n}
{\t}},{\n}
{\t}{{{\n}
{\t}{\t}"name": "user",{\n}
{\t}{\t}...{\n}
{\t}},{\n}
]{\n}
				</code>
			</pre>

			{import src/imports/tables/allowable-view-key-value-pairs.templar}

			<p>
				Each view <strong>MUST</strong> have a key of <code>name</code> which will map to the database schema and model 
				object in CamelCase naming convention.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example the <code>user_type</code> table name above will generate the 
				following model object
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>
					The <code>user_type</code> table is a <u>Constant Model</u> and differs 
					from normal other models in that constant tables cannot be updated, deleted 
					or inserted into as they are pre-generated by h2zero.
				</em>
			</p>

			{set tableUserTypeCodeLink as code}
			{import src/imports/links/link-to-code.templar}

			<p>
				The <code>user</code> table name above will generate the 
				following model object
			</p>

			{set tableUserCodeLink as code}
			{import src/imports/links/link-to-code.templar}

			<p>
				<em>
					The <code>user</code> table is a <u>Regular Model</u> object that maps to the underlying MySQL table 
					and h2zero will allow generation of all create, read, update and delete (CRUD) methods.
				</em>
			</p>


			{import src/imports/base-generated-methods.templar}


			<h4>Regular Models</h4>

			<p>
				Regular models are the default generation for h2zero and, as opposed to {import src/imports/links/constants.templar}, 
				allow access to insert new rows into the database and have access to the full range of interactions.  This is the 
				foundation for the h2zero generation.
			</p>

			<h4>Additional methods and member variables</h4>

			<p>
				In addition to the general generation mentioned above, for each of the constant models, the following field and 
				method signatures are generated:
			</p>

			<p><strong>Static Final Member Variable References</strong></p>

			<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
				<code>
private static final String SQL_INSERT = "insert into user values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";{\n}
private static final String SQL_UPDATE = "update user set id_user_type = ?, fl_is_alive = ?, num_age = ?, nm_username = ?, txt_address_email = ?, txt_password = ?, dtm_signup = ? where " + PRIMARY_KEY_FIELD + " = ?";{\n}
private static final String SQL_DELETE = "delete from user where " + PRIMARY_KEY_FIELD + " = ?";{\n}
private static final String SQL_ENSURE = "select " + PRIMARY_KEY_FIELD + " from user where id_user_type = ? and fl_is_alive = ? and num_age = ? and nm_username = ? and txt_address_email = ? and txt_password = ? and dtm_signup = ?";{\n}
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				The basic CRUD operations for the model.  Each model knows how to create, read, update and delete itself from 
				the database.  There is also an 'ensure' mode, which will be covered later in this documentation set.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Constructors</strong></p>

			<h4>Interactions</h4>

			{import src/imports/method-signatures-explanation.templar}

			<p><strong>inserts - CRUD operators (and then some)</strong></p>

			<p>
				Insert methods are not valid and consequently not generated on views as they create their rows from the <code>asClause</code>,
			</p>

			<p><strong>ensure - CRUD operators (and then some)</strong></p>

			<p>
				Ensure methods are not valid and consequently not generated on views as they create their rows from the <code>asClause</code>,
			</p>

			<p><strong>updates - CRUD operators (and then some)</strong></p>

			<p>
				Update methods are not valid and consequently not generated on views as they create their rows from the <code>asClause</code>,
			</p>


			<p><strong>insert or updates - CRUD operators (and then some)</strong></p>

			<p>
				Insert or update methods are not valid and consequently not generated on views as they create their rows from the <code>asClause</code>,
			</p>

			<p><strong>deletes - CRUD operators (and then some)</strong></p>

			<p>
				Delete methods are not valid and consequently not generated on views as they create their rows from the <code>asClause</code>,

			<p><strong>refreshes - CRUD operators (and then some)</strong></p>

			<p>
				Refresh methods are not valid and consequently not generated on views as they create their rows from the <code>asClause</code>,

			<p><strong>Getters and setters</strong></p>

			<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
				<code>
public void setIdUser(Long idUser){\n}
				</code>
			</pre>

			<p>
				Only getters are generated.
